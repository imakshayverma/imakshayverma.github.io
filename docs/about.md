## About Me

I am software developer. I currently reside in Berlin, Germany. I like building products around data. I believe that solving hard problems require deep investigation, understanding and curiousity. I like to learn about a wide array of subjects and I hope to use this medium to share some of my learning and experience. I like to have a tech agnostic approach to general problem solving and then find the most appropriate tools/services/frameworks to solve them.

I started working on a non-profit initiative building India's first Open Budget Data Platform - [OpenBudgetsIndia](https://openbudgetsindia.org/) to bring budget/fiscal transparency across different tiers of governments in India. The platform was built by 1 pizza team full time. I got oppurtunity to work on building backened systems, frontend views, data pipelines, custom data visualizations and much more. In addition, In addition, we collaborated with governments to educate bureaucrats and bring in [legislation](https://x.com/OpenBudgetsIn/status/1097412664131813376) on improving data publishing in a transparent way. These efforts contributed to help [Assam to become the best state in terms of Budgetary practices](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/assam-tops-in-budgetary-practices-followed-by-odisha-andhra-survey/articleshow/73737744.cms?from=mdr)

After this stint, I worked in Data Consultancy firm - [Gramener](https://gramener.com/). The good part about working in a consultancy firm is the pace and diversity of clientele you get exposed to. I got to work with multiple Fortune 100s, Non-profits Think Tanks and Governments on Covid Planning/Relief efforts and National Health Programmes and India's premier Space Organization. I also worked on a new product line which had an MRR of 10000$ in first three months of launch. Across different cliente, I got to build different kinds of data platforms and data products that helps clients achieve their goals and target.

I then moved to [Delivery Hero](https://www.deliveryhero.com/) building data infrastructure to process high volume data. I joined International Markets which is the strategy arm reporting to CXOs. Joined as the only engineer and completed migrations across cloud, built base data infrastructure and data science stack to run pipelines easily and cost effectively. Then I got promoted and moved team to Coredata where I currently work as well. I focus efforts on fixing foundational problems that help us built core set of tables that more majority of reporting and models in the organization.
